                    <h2>5. Acceptable use</h2>
                    <p>You agree not to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Use the App in any way that violates applicable laws or regulations</li>

                    <h2>6. Purchases and subscriptions (if applicable)</h2>
                    <p>
                        If the App offers in-app purchases or subscriptions, those transactions are handled through the
                        app store (such as Apple). Prices, billing terms, renewal rules, and cancellation options are
                        displayed at purchase time and governed by the app store’s policies.
                    </p>
                    <p class="muted">
                        Optional: If you have subscriptions, add specifics here (trial length, renewal timing, how to
                        cancel).
                    </p>

                    <h2>7. Third-party services and links</h2>
                    <p>
                        The App may rely on third-party services (for example, analytics, crash reporting, or hosting).
                        We are not responsible for third-party services not operated by us. If the App links to
                        third-party
                        sites, you access them at your own risk.
                    </p>

                    <h2>8. Intellectual property</h2>
                    <p>
                        The App, including its design, logos, trademarks, and content (excluding any third-party marks),
                        is owned by us or our licensors and is protected by applicable intellectual property laws.

                        If you submit feedback or suggestions, you grant us the right to use them without restriction or
                        compensation to you.

                    <h2>10. Availability and changes</h2>
                    <p>
                        We may modify, suspend, or discontinue the App (in whole or in part) at any time. We may also
                        update these Terms from time to time. Your continued use of the App after changes means you
                        accept the updated Terms.
                    </p>

                    <h2>11. Disclaimers</h2>

                        a
                        particular purpose, and non-infringement.
                    </p>

                    <h2>12. Limitation of liability</h2>
                    <p>
                        To the maximum extent permitted by law, we will not be liable for any indirect, incidental,
                        special,
                        consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred
                        directly or
                        indirectly, or any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses resulting from your
                        access
                        to or use of (or inability to access or use) the App.

                    <p>
                        We may suspend or terminate your access to the App at any time if you violate these Terms or if
                        we
                        reasonably believe it is necessary to protect the App, users, or third parties. You may stop
                        using
                        the App at any time by uninstalling it.
